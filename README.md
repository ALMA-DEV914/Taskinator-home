# Taskinator-home

## Tasks I have done to build this page
* Access the DOM using methods like addEventListener(), querySelector(), createElement(), setAttribute(), and getAttribute().

* Add interactivity with HTML by adding browser event listeners such as click, submit, and change.

* Handle events in JavaScript using callback functions.

* Use the event object.

* Use the DOM to both read content from the HTML page and create new content to add to or edit on the page.

* Identify DOM elements using HTML5 data attributes so that we can interact with them.

* Store task items in an organized list using an array of objects.

* Sync the data with the display in the browser.

* Save data using localStorage, and serialize and de-serialize the data using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse().

* Track technical debt and refactor the code as needed.

* Deploy the app to the internet using GitHub Pages.
